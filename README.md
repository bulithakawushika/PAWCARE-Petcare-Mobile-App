# Paw Care üê∂

### Paw Care is an Android application built with Flutter that helps pet owners manage their pet's health and well-being. The app allows users to, 

*   Track and set medicine reminders
*   Predict potential health issues based on symptoms using a machine learning model
*   Set goals for their pet's health
*   Find local veterinary services

The app uses Firebase for user authentication and data storage. It also utilizes a TensorFlow Lite model for predicting pet health issues.

# üîß Modifying the Codebase

In cases where modifications to the codebase are intended (e.g., to address issues or implement enhancements), a new Firebase project should be created under your own account, and the corresponding google-services.json file should be placed within the android/app directory.
