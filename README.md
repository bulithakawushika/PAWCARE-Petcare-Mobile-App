# Pawcare

### Paw Care is an Android application built with Flutter that helps pet owners manage their pet's health and well-being. The app allows users to, 

*   Track and set medicine reminders
*   Predict potential health issues based on symptoms using a machine learning model
*   Set goals for their pet's health
*   Find local veterinary services

The app uses Firebase for user authentication and data storage. It also utilizes a TensorFlow Lite model for predicting pet health issues.
